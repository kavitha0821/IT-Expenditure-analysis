This project focuses on analyzing IT expenditure across different business areas, regions, and cost categories using Power BI. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that provides transparency into actual vs. forecast vs. planned IT costs. The analysis highlights areas of overspending, underutilization, and budget alignment across business units and geographies.
